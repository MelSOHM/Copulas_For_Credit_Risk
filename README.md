Description of the project: You are tasked with structuring a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) comprising approximately 50 loans. To cater to varying investor risk preferences, the CLO is divided into three tranches: 0-10%, 10-30%, and 30-100%. To evaluate the risk and determine the pricing of each tranche, you decide to compare two models: one based on a Gaussian copula and the other on an Archimedean copula.

## TO DO

1. Perform a numerical comparison of Gaussian and Archimedean copulas.
2. Develop a pricing tool for CLO tranches using both copula approaches.
3. Apply the tool to the given infrastructure loans portfolio.
4. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each model, particularly in the context of infrastructure loans.
